# RFM Analysis - Summary Project

## Context

SuperStore, a global retail company, plans to run Christmas and New Year marketing campaigns to appreciate existing customers and target potential loyal ones.  

I used the RFM model, develop a Python-based deployment pipeline for segmentation evaluation.

## About the Dataset
It contains all the transactions for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. 

The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


## Python-Packages used in this project: 

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and squarify.

## How did I do it?
